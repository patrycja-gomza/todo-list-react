## Demo
https://patrycja-gomza.github.io/todo-list-react/
## General Info
This page focuses on a task list application, featuring a central interface with four key elements:
1. A button to download example tasks.
2. A form with a field for entering tasks and an "Add Task" button.
3. A search tool for tasks.
4. A dynamically generated task list from the form, offering two options:
- marking a task as completed, which crosses out its text
- removing a task from the list.

To view task details, simply click on the respective task text in the list.

Beyond the task list, the application also includes an author page, providing insights into the creator.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies
This project incorporates a variety of technologies and tools, including but not limited to:
- JSX (JavaScript XML) 
- Flexbox 
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript ES6+ Features
- React.js
- Create React App (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, CSS Loader & Style Loader)
- Controlled components (controlled by state for a single source of truth in behavior)
- Styled components (utilization of syntax with template literals)
- Media Queries
- Immutability with the immer library in Redux (for state management)
- Custom Hooks
- Local Storage with Redux-Saga
- Redux (utilizing actions, reducers, and middleware for asynchronous operations) 
- React Router (including BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, and NavLink for navigation)
- URL-related features like URLSearchParams, useLocation, useHistory: React Router and React Hooks for working with and manipulating the browser's URL
- JavaScript generator functions (pause and resume functions), providing a mechanism for powerful asynchronous programming
## Status
The site is dynamically growing, along with the new front-end programming skills I'm learning.
## Inspiration
This website is inspired by the course "Frontend Developer from the Basics" by the online programming school YouCode.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
